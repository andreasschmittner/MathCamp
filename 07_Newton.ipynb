    "# 7. Newton's Law of Cooling\n",
    "Let ChatGPT write you code that solves Newton's law of cooling using a forward difference approximation of the ODE.\n",
    "- Enter the prompt you used for ChatGPT and the resulting code. (2 points)\n",
    "- Is the result satisfactory or would you want to make adjustments to the code? Explain. (2 points)\n",
    "- Modify the code to plot solutions for different (at least three) initial conditions $T_1$, including one in which $T_1 < T_0$ the initial temperature is colder than the environment. (6 points)\n",
    "- Change the parameter K, plot results with two different K, and discuss the results. (6 points)"
