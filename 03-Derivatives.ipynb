    "# 3. Derivatives and Finite Difference Approximations\n",
    "Let's explore forward and centered difference methods to calculate the derivative using python code generated by ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt ChatGPT to plot the exact derivative of $y=x^4$ and its forward difference (FD) approximation. (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the code to explore the effect of the grid box size $\\Delta x$ on the results. Plot the errors of the approximation for different values of $\\Delta x$. (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡Tip: Start with $\\Delta x = 1$, a range of x from 1 to 10, and then change $\\Delta x$ substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the code to use the centered difference (CD) approximation and compare with FD. (8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note 1: ChatGPT may not always be correct. It gave me wrong code for the CD approximation.)\n",

    "(Note 2: For debugging code, print statements may be useful `print(myvariable)`) "
